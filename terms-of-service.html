      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      
      <p>Last updated: May 15, 2023</p>
      
      <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using any mobile applications (the "Apps") operated by Lean StartApp ("we," "us," or "our").</p>
      
      <p>By accessing or using our Apps, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the Terms, you may not access or use our Apps.</p>
      
      <h2>1. Use of Our Apps</h2>
      
      <p>By using our Apps, you agree to:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Use our Apps only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.</li>
        <li>Not use our Apps in any way that violates any applicable local, state, national, or international law or regulation.</li>
        <li>Not attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our systems or networks or breach any security or authentication measures.</li>
        <li>Not interfere with or disrupt the operation of our Apps or servers or networks connected to our Apps.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>2. Intellectual Property</h2>
      
      <p>The Apps and their original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Lean StartApp and its licensors. Our Apps are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without our prior written consent.</p>
      
      <h2>3. User Content</h2>
      
      <p>Some of our Apps may allow you to create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain your ownership rights in that content. However, by uploading content, you grant us a license to use that content, which means we can use, copy, modify, adapt, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform it.</p>
      
      <h2>4. Third-Party Links</h2>
      
      <p>Our Apps may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Lean StartApp. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or services available on or through any such websites or services.</p>
      
      <h2>5. Termination</h2>
      
      <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to our Apps immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these Terms. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>
      
      <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      
      <p>In no event shall Lean StartApp, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use our Apps; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on our Apps; (iii) any content obtained from our Apps; and (iv) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage.</p>
      
      <h2>7. Disclaimer</h2>
      
      <p>Your use of our Apps is at your sole risk. Our Apps are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We expressly disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>
      
      <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
      
      <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of China, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.</p>
      
      <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
      
      <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Apps after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>
      
      <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
